        \t\tGame Description:\n
        The Knight\'s Tour is a mathematical problem where you must move a knight on a chessboard to visit every square exactly once.\n\n
        \t\tGoal:\n
        The goal is to find a sequence of moves for the knight that covers all squares without revisiting any square.\n\n
        \t\tHow to Play:\n
        - Tap on a square to start the tour.\n
        - The knight can only move in an L-shape: two squares in a horizontal or vertical direction, then one square perpendicular to that.\n
        - Keep moving the knight until you have visited every square or there are no more valid moves.\n\n
        \t\tHints:\n
        - The hint symbols indicate the number of possible next moves from a given square.\n
        - \'+\': Recommended move according to Warnsdorff\'s rule.\n
        - \'++\': Mandatory move with only one possible next move.\n
        - \'-\': Possible but not recommended move.\n
        - \'--\': A dead-end move (no further moves possible).\n\n
        Have fun playing the Knight\'s Tour!
